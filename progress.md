# ArchStudio Portfolio Development Progress

## Project Overview
Building a modern, responsive architecture portfolio website using Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Design Decisions
- **Color Scheme**: Currently using custom Tailwind colors (arch-light, arch-dark, arch-accent)
- **Images**: Static images stored in public/images directory
- **Dark Mode**: Not implemented in initial phase
- **Animations**: Subtle and professional hover effects (added to hero section)
