# LineSpaceStudio Portfolio Development Progress

## Project Overview
Building a modern, responsive architecture portfolio website using Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Design Decisions
- **Color Scheme**: Currently using custom Tailwind colors (arch-light, arch-dark, arch-accent)
- **Images**: Static images stored in public/images directory
- **Dark Mode**: Not implemented in initial phase
- **Animations**: Subtle and professional hover effects (added to hero section)
- **Content Management**: Hardcoded content initially
- **Filtering**: Client-side filtering for projects
- **Featured Projects**: Configurable vi props, starting with 4 placeholders
- **Branding**: Implemented consistent logo and brand name across header and footer

- Hero component complete with image optimization

## Current Blockers
1. ~~Missing critical components~~ (Resolved)
2. Image handling:
   - Need to implement image optimization across all components
   - Testing needed for image optimization utility

3. Content Integration:
   - Need real content for services section
   - Project images pending
   - Team member photos needed

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Implement image optimization in Services component
2. Add real project images and content
